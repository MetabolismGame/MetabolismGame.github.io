    <h1 class="c">THE METABOLISM GAME</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <p class="lift">THE METABOLISM GAME is an enjoyable way for biology students to learn the
        basic pathways and principles of the cell's energy metabolism. Each player
        represents a living cell faced with the problem of acquiring energy from
        carbon compounds in a convienent, usable form -- the ATP molecule. Players
        move tokens representing carbon atoms through various enzymatic reations,
        generating ATP as they go. </p>
    <h2 class="lift">OBJECT</h2>
    <p class="tab lift">  The object of the game is to generate as much ATP as possible. The
        winner may be the first player to accumulate an agreed-upon number of ATP
        molecules (40 is a reasonable goal). If you prefer, ther winner may be the
        player with the most ATP at a fixed time period. </p>
    <h2 class="lift">MATERIALS</h2>
    <p class="secTab lift"> THE GAME BOARD. Shows the pathways and enzymes of glycolysis (color-coded <br />
        blue) and the Krebs cycle (color-coded yellow).</p>
    <p class="secTab2"> ENZYME CARDS. A deck of 70 cards, including three of each of 22 different <br />
        enzymes, and four wild enzyme cards. </p>
    <p class="secTab2"> OXYGEN CARDS. Eight. </p>
    <p class="secTab2">PLAYING TOKENS. Four sets of 18 tokens which represent carbon atoms. </p>
    <p class="secTab2">ATP CURRENCY. Twenty each of three denominations, representing one, three,
        and ten ATP molecules. </p>
    <p class="secTab2">NADH+H- TOKENS. Ten. </p>
    <p class="secTab2">FADH2 TOKENS. Ten. </p>
    <h2 class="lift"> PREPARING TO PLAY </h2>
      <p class="lift"> THE METABOLISM GAME is designed for two to four players. To start, each
        player recieves 18 carbon atom tokens (of one color) and two units of ATP.
        Place the remaing ATP currency and the FADH2 and NADH+H+ tokens in a
        convenient location to serve as the "bank". Shuffle the enzyme cards with
        the oxygen cards thoroughly. Deal nine cards to each player. place the
        rest of the deck face down to serve as the draw pile. Turn the top card face
        up next to the draw pile to serve as the discard pile.</p>
    <h2 class="lift"> PLAYING THE GAME</h2>
      <p class="lift"> Each player begins a turn by drawing the top card from either the draw pile
        or the discard pile. A card drawn from the discard pile (or one identical
        to it) may not be used in the current turn. The player continues a turn
        by carrying out any of the three kinds of plays listed below (if its possible
        to do so). at the end of the turn the player draws sufficient cards from
        the draw pile to restore his or her hand to nine cards. <p>
      <p>Whenever the draw pile is exhausted, leave the top card from either the
        discard pile, suffle the remaining cards and place them face down to
        restore the draw pile. </p>
      <p> There are three kinds of plays: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> CARBON ENTRY. The player places the correct number of carbon
            atoms on any one of the three carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, or
            succinate. These are color-coded green on the game board. No cards
            are used for carbon entry. A player may enter only one carbon compound
            per turn</li>
          <li> ENZYMATIC REACTION. The player moves one carbon compound from
            space to space as indicated by the arrows on the board. At each move
            (reaction) the player must discard, face up, the appropriate enzyme
            card or a wild enzyme card. If a player has enzyme cards for several
            reactions in swquence, he or she may carry out those reaction in one
            turn.
          <p class="tab">Some of the reactions are reversible and these are indicated on the board
            by two-headed arrows. An enzyme for a reversible reaction may catalyze
            that reaction in either direction. </p>
          <p class="tab">Certain reactions require ATP, as indicated on the board. A player
            making such a move must return an ATP molecule to the bank. Occastionally
            certain reactions may be carried out in reverse requiring NADH+H+ of
            FADH2. Other reactions generate ATP, NADH+H+, or FADH2 and the player
            collects the appropriate molecules from the bank. (Note: The player
            collects one ATP in moving from succinyl-CoA to succinate, because the
            GTP generated in this step is energetically equivalent to ATP.) If,
            while carrying out a series of reactions, a player accumulates two tokens
            representing reduced electron carriers (NADH+H+ or FADH2), he or she is
            considered to be in oxygen dept and must carry out oxidative phosphorylation,
            before continuing. If the player cannot carry out oxidative phosphorylation,
            the turn ends with the player in oxygen debt. The player may make no other play
            in this or subsequent turns until he or she obtains an oxygen card and removes
            the oxygen debt (see below). <br />
                In making enzymatic reactions, the player must be careful to keep
            track of the number of carbon atoms in each compound. These are
            indicated on the game board. Note that in some reactions, a single
            reactant molecule spilts into two product molecules; in other moves,
            two reactant molecules must combine to form the product. <br />
            In the reaction that converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate, CO2 is required.
            The player must have a carbon atom to add to the pyruvate molecule to
            make this move. In several other reactions, carbon is spilt off from
            the molecule and CO2 is generated; the player must be sure to remove
            a carbon atom from the reactant compound at these points. Carbon atoms
            reclaimed in this way are available for Carbon Entry.</li>
