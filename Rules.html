    <div class="column">
      <p>THE METABOLISM GAME is an enjoyable way for biology students to learn the
        basic pathways and principles of the cell's energy metabolism. Each player
        represents a living cell faced with the problem of acquiring energy from
        carbon compounds in a convienent, usable form -- the ATP molecule. Players
        move tokens representing carbon atoms through various enzymatic reations,
        generating ATP as they go. </p>
    <h2>OBJECT</h2>
    <p>  The object of the game is to generate as much ATP as possible. The
        winner may be the first player to accumulate an agreed-upon number of ATP
        molecules (40 is a reasonable goal). If you prefer, ther winner may be the
        player with the most ATP at a fixed time period. </p>
    <h2>MATERIALS</h2>
    <p> THE GAME BOARD. Shows the pathways and enzymes of glycolysis (color-coded <br />
        blue) and the Krebs cycle (color-coded yellow).<br />
        ENZYME CARDS. A deck of 70 cards, including three of each of 22 different <br />
        enzymes, and four wild enzyme cards. <br />
        OXYGEN CARDS. Eight. <br />
        PLAYING TOKENS. Four sets of 18 tokens which represent carbon atoms. <br />
        ATP CURRENCY. Twenty each of three denominations, representing one, three, <br />
        and ten ATP molecules. <br />
        NADH+H- TOKENS. Ten. <br />
        FADH2 TOKENS. Ten. <br /></p>
    <h2> PREPARING TO PLAY </h2>
      <p> THE METABOLISM GAME is designed for two to four players. To start, each
        player recieves 18 carbon atom tokens (of one color) and two units of ATP.
        Place the remaing ATP currency and the FADH2 and NADH+H+ tokens in a
        convenient location to serve as the "bank". Shuffle the enzyme cards with
        the oxygen cards thoroughly. Deal nine cards to each player. place the
        rest of the deck face down to serve as the draw pile. Turn the top card face
        up next to the draw pile to serve as the discard pile.</p>
